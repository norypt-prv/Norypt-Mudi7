**Radio-identity rotation for the GL-iNet GL-E5800 (Mudi 7) 5G mobile hotspot** — dual-slot IMEI rotation, MAC/BSSID/SSID/hostname/password randomization, a two-stage SIM-swap flow, and volatile client-MAC storage, controlled from the command line, a LuCI admin page, or the device's touchscreen.

Norypt Ghost is derived from [blue-merle-v2](https://github.com/WSchlesner/blue-merle-v2) (GPL-2.0), itself a ground-up rewrite of [SRLabs' blue-merle](https://github.com/srlabs/blue-merle) for the Mudi 7 — a device with a completely different modem (Quectel RG650V-NA, integrated MHI instead of USB), a rewritten `gl_modem` wrapper, dual SIM + eSIM support, a touchscreen instead of a hardware switch, and a new UCI layout. See [Attribution](#attribution).

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Dual IMEI rotation** | Both modem IMEI slots (SIM 1 + SIM 2/eSIM) rotated independently via `AT+EGMR`, persisted to modem NV |
| **Three IMEI modes** | Per-slot: **Random** (Luhn-valid, band-matched TAC), **Deterministic** (stable hash of the SIM's IMSI), or **Static** (user-supplied) |
| **Consistent wireless identity** | One router vendor per rotation: all BSSIDs share a single OUI and the SSID broadcasts a matching brand name — no impossible vendor mixes |
| **Wireless rotation** | BSSIDs/MACs, SSID, hostname, and Wi-Fi passwords randomized on demand or on every boot |
| **Two-stage SIM swap** | Throwaway IMEIs written before poweroff; final IMEIs written on next boot *before* the modem first attaches — neither real identity bridges the swap |
| **Volatile client MACs** | `tmpfs` mounted over GL-iNet's client-MAC database — connected-device history never reaches flash |
| **Network visibility** | Per-slot registration state, operator, and signal in both the CLI and LuCI |
| **Health check** | `norypt-ghost check` — 16-point read-only self-test of the modem, generator, frames, and services |
| **Three control surfaces** | CLI over SSH, LuCI admin page, and a 2-second touchscreen long-press for SIM swap |
| **GL-iNet UI sync** | Settings → About Device shows the new IMEI automatically after every rotation |
| **Splash screens** | Six full-screen status frames written straight to the framebuffer during operations |

---

## Compatibility

| | |
|---|---|
| **Device** | GL-iNet GL-E5800 (Mudi 7) |
| **Firmware** | GL.iNet 4.8.3 (OpenWrt 23.05.4) and 4.8.5 |
| **Modem firmware** | `RG650VNA01ACR02A04G8G` (unchanged between 4.8.3 and 4.8.5) |
| **Architecture** | `aarch64_cortex-a53` |
| **Dependencies** | `luci-base`, `lua`, `luabitop` — all present in stock firmware |

The installer verifies the device model and firmware version before touching anything. Unknown firmware versions prompt for confirmation (interactive SSH installs only; non-interactive installs on unknown firmware abort safely).

> **Firmware upgrades remove the package without running its uninstall hooks.** Factory state survives in `/etc/config/norypt-ghost`, but the modem keeps its rotated IMEIs and GL-iNet's own BSSID randomization stays disabled until you reinstall Norypt Ghost (or restore manually). Reinstall after every firmware upgrade.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Enable LuCI** (bundled with the firmware, off by default — no internet required):

1. Open the GL-iNet web UI at `http://192.168.8.1`
2. Go to **System → Advanced Settings**
3. Click **Install Now** — this just starts the `uhttpd` web server
4. LuCI is now at `http://192.168.8.1:8080`

**2. Install the package:**

```sh
scp -O norypt-ghost_1.0.0-Script-Local.ipk root@192.168.8.1:/tmp/
ssh root@192.168.8.1 opkg install /tmp/norypt-ghost_1.0.0-Script-Local.ipk
```

Expected output (identifiers below are illustrative placeholders):

```
Installing norypt-ghost (1.0.0) to root...
Firmware 4.8.5 confirmed supported.
Configuring norypt-ghost.
norypt-ghost: capturing factory state...
  IMEI (slot 1):   <factory IMEI slot 1>
  IMEI (slot 2):   <factory IMEI slot 2>
  WiFi MAC (2.4g): <factory BSSID>
  SSID:            GL-E5800-xxxx
  Hostname:        GL-E5800
  WiFi keys saved: main + guest
norypt-ghost: factory state saved to /etc/config/norypt-ghost
norypt-ghost: installation complete. Rotate identity via: norypt-ghost rotate
```

The original device identity is captured **once** at install time and is never overwritten — reinstalls and upgrades (`opkg install --force-reinstall`) preserve it.

**3. Verify and rotate:**

```sh
ssh root@192.168.8.1
norypt-ghost check     # everything should PASS
norypt-ghost rotate    # first identity rotation
```

The admin page is under **Services → Norypt Ghost** in LuCI.

---

## Usage

### LuCI admin page

**Services → Norypt Ghost** (`http://192.168.8.1:8080`):

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| **IMEI** | Current vs. factory IMEI per slot, IMSI, and live network state (registration / operator / signal — loaded asynchronously). Rotated values are highlighted green. |
| **Wireless/System Identity** | Current vs. factory SSID, all nine MACs/BSSIDs, hostname, and the main/guest Wi-Fi passwords (masked, with Show/Hide). |
| **Rotation Options** | Boot-rotation master toggle + per-feature checkboxes; per-slot IMEI mode radios (Random / Deterministic / Static) with inline-validated static IMEI fields; re-attach timeout; touchscreen trigger toggle. Every control saves instantly with a ✓ flash. |
| **Actions** | Rotate IMEIs, Rotate Wireless/System, SIM Swap (double-confirmed — powers the device off), Restore Factory. Last-rotation timestamps below. |
| **Last Command Log** | Output of the most recent operation (`/tmp/norypt-ghost.log`). |

> Screenshots are intentionally not committed: the admin page displays live IMEIs, IMSIs, and BSSIDs, and a screenshot of a real unit publishes them permanently.

### Command line

```sh
norypt-ghost status            # identity + network registration overview
norypt-ghost check             # health check (see below)
norypt-ghost rotate            # rotate both IMEIs, cycle RF, wait for re-attach
norypt-ghost rotate-wireless   # rotate MACs/SSID/hostname/password immediately
norypt-ghost sim-swap          # stage 1 of the SIM-swap flow (powers off!)
norypt-ghost restore           # restore every factory value
norypt-ghost install           # (re-)capture factory state — idempotent
norypt-ghost help              # full usage, including per-slot mode flags
```

Per-slot IMEI modes can be set for a single run (`--slot1=deterministic --slot2=random`, or `--random`/`--deterministic`/`--static` for both) — invalid modes and unknown options fail loudly rather than silently falling back. Persistent mode defaults live in UCI (see [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference)).

Example `rotate`:

```
norypt-ghost: disabling RF before IMEI write...
norypt-ghost: generating IMEIs (slot1=random, slot2=random)...
  Slot 1 IMEI: <generated>
  Slot 2 IMEI: <generated>
  Slot 1 IMEI confirmed: <generated>
  Slot 2 IMEI confirmed: <generated>
norypt-ghost: cycling modem RF for network re-attach...
norypt-ghost: done.
```

`status` includes a Network section — the first place to look when a SIM won't connect:

```
=== Network ===
  Slot 1 registration: registered (home)
  Slot 2 registration: not registered (idle)
  Operator: <carrier>
  Signal:   -77 dBm
```

### Touchscreen trigger

Hold the **clock in the top-left corner** of the home screen for **2 seconds** to start a SIM swap — identical to running `norypt-ghost sim-swap` over SSH, no laptop needed.

The `norypt-ghost-touch` daemon (a small statically linked C binary, source in `src/`) reads `/dev/input/event0` without grabbing it, so the stock `gl_screen` UI keeps working normally. Guards against accidental triggers:

- 2-second hold required — quick taps are logged and ignored
- 10-second cooldown between triggers
- Blocked while a sim-swap is already in progress (stage file present)

Toggle it (persists across reboots and reinstalls) from LuCI → Rotation Options → **Touchscreen Trigger**, or over SSH: `/etc/init.d/norypt-ghost-touch disable && /etc/init.d/norypt-ghost-touch stop`.

### Health check

`norypt-ghost check` is a read-only self-test — run it any time something seems off, or after a firmware update:

```
=== norypt-ghost health check ===

Modem:
  PASS  gl_modem present
  PASS  AT socket present (/tmp/modem.CPU.AT.sock)
  PASS  modem answers AT commands
  PASS  IMEI readable (slot 1: <current IMEI>)

IMEI generator:
  PASS  lua generator produces valid IMEIs (sample: <generated>)
  PASS  TAC pool present (7 TACs)
  PASS  OUI pool present (20 router identities)

Splash frames:
  PASS  all 6 frames present
  PASS  framebuffer present (/dev/fb0)

Services:
  PASS  norypt-ghost-volatile-macs enabled
  PASS  norypt-ghost-wireless enabled
  PASS  norypt-ghost-sim-swap enabled
  PASS  norypt-ghost-touch enabled and running
  PASS  client-MAC database is RAM-backed (tmpfs mounted)

State:
  PASS  factory state saved

Result: all checks passed.
```

Exit code is non-zero if anything FAILs, so it can be scripted.

---

## How It Works

### What it protects (and what it can't)

Norypt Ghost reduces the **device-identity** trail a mobile hotspot leaves behind: the IMEI broadcast to cell towers, the Wi-Fi MACs/BSSIDs/SSID visible to anyone scanning nearby, the hostname, and the on-flash history of clients that connected. It cannot anonymize what it doesn't control:

- **The SIM is an identity.** The IMSI/ICCID identify the subscriber regardless of IMEI. Rotating the IMEI without swapping the SIM only unlinks the *hardware*; use the SIM-swap flow (new SIM + new IMEI + new location, together) for a clean break.
- **The eSIM EID is permanent.** The eUICC's EID is a fixed hardware identifier presented during remote SIM provisioning and cannot be rotated.
- **Location and usage patterns correlate.** Re-appearing in the same place, at the same times, with the same traffic patterns can re-link identities no rotation can hide.
- **Upstream traffic is out of scope.** Use a VPN/Tor on top; Norypt Ghost handles the radio identity layer only.
- **Wired MACs are not yet rotated.** Only the Wi-Fi interfaces are covered — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).

The deterministic IMEI mode trades unlinkability for consistency — see [IMEI modes](#imei-modes).

### Boot sequence

| Priority | Service | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| S9 | `norypt-ghost-volatile-macs` | Mounts `tmpfs` over `/etc/oui-tertf/` before GL-iNet's client tracker starts — the client-MAC database lives in RAM and evaporates at every reboot. |
| S10 | `norypt-ghost-wireless` | If boot rotation is enabled: rotates MACs, SSID, hostname, and Wi-Fi passwords *before* the APs come up. |
| S23 | `gl_cellular_manager` | GL-iNet's modem init daemon — the first point in boot where the AT socket accepts commands. |
| S25 | `norypt-ghost-sim-swap` | Only when a sim-swap is pending: waits for the AT socket, disables RF, writes the final IMEIs, re-enables RF. The throwaway IMEI from Stage 1 is replaced before the modem ever attaches. Exits instantly on normal boots. |
| S80 | `gl_screen` | GL-iNet's touchscreen UI daemon. |
| S81 | `norypt-ghost-touch` | The long-press trigger daemon (procd-managed, auto-respawns). |

### IMEI rotation

1. RF off (`AT+CFUN=4`) — the old IMEI stops transmitting before anything is written
2. Both slots written via `AT+EGMR` (field 7 = Slot 1, field 11 = Slot 2/eSIM), NV-persisted with `AT+QPRTPARA=1`
3. RF on (`AT+CFUN=1`) + automatic operator re-attach (`AT+COPS=0`)
4. Registration polled via `AT+CEREG?` until attached or the configured timeout (default 120 s)
5. `gl_cellular_manager` restarted so GL-iNet's cached IMEI (Settings → About Device) matches the modem

A re-attach timeout is **non-fatal**: the warning screen is shown, RF stays on, and the modem keeps retrying in the background — relevant for factory-fresh SIMs whose first activation can take the carrier several minutes.

If a *write* fails, Norypt Ghost deliberately leaves RF **off** rather than transmitting a half-rotated identity, shows the error screen, and prints recovery steps (re-run, `norypt-ghost restore`, or `gl_modem -B CPU -U 1 AT 'AT+CFUN=1'` to force RF back on).

### IMEI modes

**Random** (default) — a TAC from `tac_pool.json` + 6 random serial digits + Luhn check digit. The pool is curated to 5G sub-6 hotspots/handsets whose band sets overlap the RG650V-NA's (n2/n5/n12/n25/n41/n66/n70/n71/n77/n78). This matters: carriers can compare a reported IMEI's expected capabilities against the cell it connects on, and a 4G-only TAC on a 5G NR cell is a contradiction — confirmed on real hardware to trigger ~10 Mbps throttling on at least one US carrier. Don't add LTE-only TACs to the pool.

**Deterministic** — `IMEI = luhn(tac_pool[djb2(IMSI) % n] + serial(djb2(IMSI)))`. The same SIM always maps to the same IMEI, useful when a carrier flags frequent IMEI changes on one subscription. **Privacy trade-off:** djb2 is a public, unkeyed hash — anyone who once observes the IMEI+IMSI pairing can re-derive the link forever. Random is strictly better for unlinkability. (Keying this hash with a per-install secret is on the [Roadmap](#roadmap).)

**Static** — a user-supplied 15-digit IMEI, Luhn-validated in the LuCI form *and* server-side. Written verbatim on every rotation.

All three fall back to Random (with a warning) if their inputs are unavailable, so a rotation never fails because of a missing IMSI or an unset static value.

### SIM-swap flow

The problem with a naive swap: if the modem ever holds *old SIM + new IMEI* (or vice versa), the two identities become linkable. Norypt Ghost splits the swap across a power cycle so they never coexist on air:

1. **Stage 1** (`norypt-ghost sim-swap`, touchscreen, or LuCI): RF off → random **throwaway** IMEIs written to both slots → state saved → device powers off
2. You swap SIM(s) — and ideally location — while it's off
3. **Stage 2** (S25, automatic on next boot): final IMEIs (per your configured modes) are written *before* the modem's first attach; the throwaway IMEIs never register

If Stage 2 can't reach the modem it leaves the pending state in place and retries next boot — the modem keeps the harmless throwaway identity in the meantime.

### MAC, BSSID, and SSID randomization

Every rotation picks **one router identity** — a single vendor OUI plus its SSID brand — from the curated pool in `oui_pool.json`:

- All six AP interfaces (`wifi2g/5g/6g` + guests) get that one OUI with random NIC bytes, like a real consumer router. Mixing vendors across bands is a fingerprinting flag no real device exhibits.
- The SSID becomes `<brand>-XXXX` to match (e.g., a Netgear OUI broadcasts `NETGEAR-A3F1`). Vendors whose factory SSIDs aren't brand-prefixed (Google Nest, Meraki) use a generic `HOME-XXXX`, plausible with any OUI.
- The **STA (repeater) interface** gets a *client*-class OUI (Apple/Intel/Samsung laptops and phones) — upstream networks see a client device, not a router.
- The **locally-administered bit** is forced on every generated MAC: the Qualcomm `ath11k` driver requires LA MACs for runtime channel changes on AP interfaces (GL-iNet's channel co-location in repeater mode breaks with UA MACs). **This has a cost** — an LA bit is itself a randomization signal to anyone scanning. See [Roadmap](#roadmap).

GL-iNet's own `random_bssid` feature is disabled at install (it generates UA MACs on its own schedule) and re-enabled at uninstall. Hostname becomes `router-XXXX`; main and guest networks get independent random 12-hex-character passwords.

### Volatile client MACs

GL-iNet's `gl_clients` daemon keeps a persistent database of every client MAC that ever connected, at `/etc/oui-tertf/client.db` on flash. At S9 Norypt Ghost deletes the on-flash copy and mounts a `tmpfs` over the directory — the daemon keeps writing without knowing it's writing to RAM, and the history starts empty every boot.

(The old file is unlinked, not overwritten: the Mudi 7's overlay is ext4 on eMMC, whose flash translation layer remaps writes — overwrite-in-place tools like `shred` are ineffective there. The tmpfs mount is the real protection.)

### Splash screens

During operations, Norypt Ghost stops `gl_screen` and writes pre-rendered frames (240×320 RGB565) directly to `/dev/fb0`:

| | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![Rotating](screens/previews/rotating.png) | ![Done](screens/previews/done.png) | ![SIM Swap](screens/previews/simswap.png) |
| ![Restoring](screens/previews/restoring.png) | ![Warning](screens/previews/warning.png) | ![Error](screens/previews/error.png) |

| Frame | Shown when |
|---|---|
| `rotating` | IMEI rotation or sim-swap Stage 2 in progress |
| `done` | Operation complete and modem re-registered |
| `simswap` | Stage 1: powering off for the SIM swap |
| `restoring` | Factory restore in progress |
| `warning` | Soft failure: IMEIs written but no re-registration within the timeout (modem keeps retrying) |
| `error` | Hard failure: a write failed; **RF is left off** until recovered |

Frames are generated by `screens/generate.py` (Python 3 + Pillow, dev-side only — the device never needs Python) and committed as binaries. To modify: edit the `FRAMES` list, run `python3 generate.py`, commit the regenerated `.rgb565` files and PNG previews.

Implementation note: `gl_screen` respawns via procd, so a plain `stop` would repaint over our frame within seconds — `_screen_splash` first removes it from procd's watch list (`ubus call service delete`), then stops it, then writes the frame. A separate GL-iNet boot process draws a progress bar at a fixed screen position during early boot; the `rotating`/`done` layouts leave that row empty so Stage 2 splashes aren't overdrawn.

---

## Configuration Reference

Everything lives in `/etc/config/norypt-ghost` (standard UCI). The `factory` section is written once at install; the `options` section is yours:

```
config norypt-ghost 'options'
    option randomize_on_boot    '1'        # rotate wireless identity at every boot
    option randomize_mac        '1'        # per-feature toggles for boot + rotate-wireless
    option randomize_ssid       '1'
    option randomize_hostname   '1'
    option randomize_password   '1'
    option imei_mode_slot1      'random'   # random | deterministic | static
    option imei_mode_slot2      'random'
    option static_imei_slot1    ''         # used when the slot's mode is 'static'
    option static_imei_slot2    ''
    option register_timeout     '120'      # seconds to wait for re-attach (10-600)
    option touch_enabled        '1'        # touchscreen trigger preference
```

All values are editable from the LuCI page (changes apply instantly) or via `uci set norypt-ghost.options.<name>=<value> && uci commit norypt-ghost`. Every value is validated server-side — malformed input is rejected, never written to the modem.

> **The `factory` section stores your device's real IMEIs, MACs, SSIDs and Wi-Fi keys in cleartext on flash.** That is what makes `restore` and clean uninstalls possible, but it also means anyone with the device recovers its true identity. Encrypting or discarding this state is on the [Roadmap](#roadmap).

---

## Building from Source

The touchscreen daemon is compiled from `src/` — no binaries are committed to this repository.

### 1. `build-ipk.sh` — no OpenWrt SDK required

```sh
git clone https://github.com/norypt-prv/Norypt-Mudi7.git
cd Norypt-Mudi7
sudo apt install -y gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu   # or have Docker available
./build-ipk.sh
```

Needs `bash`, `tar`, `gzip`, and an aarch64 cross-compiler (or Docker, used automatically as a fallback). Produces `norypt-ghost_1.0.0-Script-Local.ipk` from the `files/` tree, building `norypt-ghost-touch` first if it is missing or older than its source. **Use for:** day-to-day development and offline builds.

### 2. OpenWrt SDK — `Makefile`

A standard OpenWrt package recipe that compiles the daemon against the exact target toolchain:

```sh
# Use the 23.05.4 ipq807x/generic SDK — the same OpenWrt release the GL-E5800
# firmware is based on, and the same aarch64_cortex-a53 musl ABI. (The
# GL-E5800's IPQ9574 SoC has no upstream stable SDK of its own; any 23.05.4
# aarch64_cortex-a53 target produces an identical package.)
curl -fLO https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/23.05.4/targets/ipq807x/generic/openwrt-sdk-23.05.4-ipq807x-generic_gcc-12.3.0_musl.Linux-x86_64.tar.xz
tar -xJf openwrt-sdk-23.05.4-*.tar.xz && cd openwrt-sdk-23.05.4-*/

ln -s /path/to/Norypt-Mudi7 package/norypt-ghost
make defconfig
make package/norypt-ghost/compile V=s
```

Output: `bin/packages/aarch64_cortex-a53/base/norypt-ghost_1.0.0-1_aarch64_cortex-a53.ipk`. **Use for:** reproducible/auditable builds or opkg feed submission.

### 3. GitHub Actions — both build paths, automatically

Two workflows run on every push, PR, and release tag:

| Workflow | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|
| [`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) | Fast path — installs `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` and runs `build-ipk.sh` | `norypt-ghost_<version>-Script-{CI\|Release}.ipk` |
| [`sdk-build.yml`](.github/workflows/sdk-build.yml) | Downloads the pinned 23.05.4 SDK (checksum-verified) and builds via the `Makefile` | `norypt-ghost_<version>-SDK-{CI\|Release}.ipk` |

Both upload their IPK as a workflow artifact (retained 30 days). On a `v*.*.*` tag, a GitHub Release is created with **both** IPKs attached:

```sh
git tag v1.1.0 && git push origin v1.1.0
```

The full release procedure — version bumping, tagging rules, and a command reference — is documented in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

### Building the touch daemon on its own

```sh
./tools/build-touch.sh
```

Uses `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` if present, otherwise Docker + QEMU with Alpine/musl. Output is stripped; `build-ipk.sh` refuses to package an unstripped binary.

### Development deploy

`./deploy.sh [host]` (default `root@192.168.8.1`) copies the working tree straight onto a device over SCP and re-registers the services — fast iteration without rebuilding the IPK. It does **not** run factory capture; run `norypt-ghost install` manually if needed.

---

## Uninstalling

```sh
opkg remove norypt-ghost
```

`prerm` stops and disables all services and **restores the full factory identity** (IMEIs, MACs, SSIDs, passwords, hostname); `postrm` re-enables GL-iNet's BSSID randomization and removes runtime state. Factory state in `/etc/config/norypt-ghost` is intentionally left behind so a future reinstall keeps the original values — delete it for a clean slate:

```sh
uci delete norypt-ghost.factory && uci delete norypt-ghost.options && uci commit norypt-ghost
```

---

## AT Commands We Deliberately Avoid

Hard-won knowledge from bricking-adjacent experiments on the RG650V-NA — none of these are used, and none should be added:

| Command | Why not |
|---|---|
| `AT+QPOWD` | Leaves the modem unresponsive until a full device reboot |
| `AT+CFUN=1,1` | Reboots the entire device, not just the modem RF |
| `AT+QPRTPARA=3` | Quectel factory reset — undefined behavior on carrier units |
| `AT+QUIMSUB` | Breaks the AT socket until reboot |
| `ubus call cellular.cm cm_stop_dial` | Persists `allow_dial=0` to flash; cellular manager then skips SIM detection on every subsequent boot |
| Writes to the RAWDATA MMC partition | Where the factory MAC lives; corruption is unrecoverable |
| Default eSIM profile deletion | Cannot be restored without a factory reset |

---

## Project Status

Inherited as device-verified on firmware 4.8.5 by the upstream project: install/uninstall lifecycle, dual-IMEI rotate and restore (live `AT+EGMR` writes confirmed), wireless rotation, volatile MACs, all six splash frames, the LuCI page, the touchscreen daemon, and the health check.

**Not yet re-verified on Norypt hardware.** The rebrand changed every installed path, service name, and UCI namespace; a full install → check → rotate → restore → uninstall pass on a Norypt unit is required before this is called shipped.

**Pending live-SIM validation** (requires an activated SIM):

- [ ] Re-registration after rotate (`+CEREG` 1/5, end-to-end)
- [ ] Deterministic mode end-to-end (IMSI → IMEI → carrier attach)
- [ ] Full two-stage sim-swap with a physical SIM change
- [ ] Throwaway IMEI exposure window check (`logread | grep "sim-swap throwaway"`)

---

## Roadmap

Ranked improvements, with rationale and effort estimates, are tracked in **[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)**. The headline items:

1. Verify and expand the TAC pool (7 unverified entries today)
2. Block 2G/3G downgrade — the standard IMSI-catcher entry path
3. Rotate the wired WAN/LAN MAC, not just Wi-Fi
4. Encrypt or discard the cleartext factory-identity state on flash
5. Reconsider the forced locally-administered MAC bit
6. Key the deterministic IMEI hash with a per-install secret
7. Single-command "new identity" that rotates every layer at once
8. Serving-cell monitoring / IMSI-catcher detection
